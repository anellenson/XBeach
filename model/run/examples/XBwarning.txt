  Warning: 2D absorbing boundary condition [front=abs_2d] reduces to a
           1D absorbing boundary condition [front=abs_1d] in
           1D mode [ny=0]
  Warning: 2D absorbing boundary condition [back=abs_2d] reduces to a
           1D absorbing boundary condition [back=abs_1d] in
           1D mode [ny=0]
  Warning: shallow water so long wave variance is reduced using par%nmax
